### Problem: Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero

**Problem Statement:**
You are given an array of positive integers, `candidates`. You need to evaluate the **bitwise AND** of every possible combination of numbers in `candidates`, where each number in `candidates` can only be used once per combination. The task is to find the **size of the largest subset** (combination) of numbers such that the **bitwise AND** of all numbers in that subset is **greater than 0**.

The **bitwise AND** operation of a group of numbers results in a number where each bit is `1` only if the corresponding bit in each number is also `1`.

**Return:** The size of the largest subset where the bitwise AND of all elements is greater than zero.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `candidates = [16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14]`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:** The subset `[16, 17, 62, 24]` has a bitwise AND of `16 & 17 & 62 & 24 = 16`, which is greater than 0. The size of this subset is `4`. It can be shown that there is no larger subset with a bitwise AND greater than 0.
  - Another example of a maximum subset: `[62, 12, 24, 14]`, with a bitwise AND result of `8`, also greater than 0.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** `candidates = [8, 8]`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The subset `[8, 8]` has a bitwise AND of `8 & 8 = 8`, which is greater than 0. The size of this subset is `2`, so we return `2`.

**Constraints:**

- \(1 \leq \text{candidates.length} \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq \text{candidates[i]} \leq 10^7\)
